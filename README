# steps

1. Create word2vec from text
    > python3 clear_create_word2vec.py 

2. Convert word2vec file to ids matrix as a numpy file format in order to use with tensorflow
    > python3 numpy_embedding_matrix_tf.py

3. Use embedding matrix with tensorflow in eager mode
    > python3 convert_text_to_seqvector_through_embedmatrix.py

# TODOs

1. Write some scrapers for ikon.mn
2. Prepare training texts with its labels, label should be a type of news. For example: politics, economy, society, health, world, technology etc
3. Train them
4. Try to classify text from other sites, for example: news.gogo.mn
